A backdoor is an undocumented method of gaining access to program or a computer by using another  installed program or rootkit that bypasses normal authentication. The backdoor is generally written by the programmer who created the original program and is often only known to that person. Using backdoors are an effective way to regain access to a computer that the intruders have already compromised. They can often bypass security measures such as firewalls, password protection and intrusion detection systems. Backdoors are installed on one’s computer by attaching themselves to one of the over 65,000 ports computers have for internet communication. The intruder sets up a backdoor (also called a “server”) and has it “listen” for incoming connections on a specific port. They then use a “client” to tell the server backdoor that they are going to enter the machine. The server then welcomes them in, bypassing the computer’s security.

Because many of these backdoors are also viruses, worms and other malware, antivirus software is always identifying new backdoors that can be removed from a client’s system. You can avoid vulnerability to backdoors by running quality antivirus software, maintaining updates to your operating system and other installed software and by using caution when you open email attachments, even when it looks like it’s from someone you know. It’s also a good idea to use your antivirus tools to scan all attachments & downloads before opening them.

A backdoor is a method, often secret, of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer system, a product, or an embedded device (e.g. a home router), or its embodiment, e.g. as part of a cryptosystem, an algorithm, a chipset, or a "homunculus computer". Backdoors are often used for securing remote access to a computer, or obtaining access to plaintext in cryptographic systems.

A backdoor may take the form of a hidden part of a program one uses, a separate program (e.g. Back Orifice may subvert the system through a rootkit), or code in the firmware of ones hardware or parts of ones operating system such as Microsoft Windows. Although normally surreptitiously installed, in some cases backdoors are deliberate and widely known. These kinds of backdoors might have "legitimate" uses such as providing the manufacturer with a way to restore user passwords.

Default passwords (or other default credentials) can function as backdoors if they are not changed by the user. Some debugging features can also act as backdoors if they are not removed in the release version.
